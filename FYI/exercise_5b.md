# Exercise 5B: Framework0 Foundation - Health Monitoring System

## Overview

The Health Monitoring System is the second core foundation component for Framework0, designed to provide comprehensive system monitoring, health checks, and performance tracking capabilities that integrate seamlessly with the logging infrastructure.

## Architecture Design

### Modular Components

Following the team guidelines for modularity and single responsibility:

#### 1. `health_core.py` (~350 lines)
**Purpose**: Core health monitoring infrastructure
- Health metric data classes and enums
- Monitoring configuration management
- Base health check interfaces
- Metric collection utilities

**Key Classes**:
- `HealthStatus` (enum): HEALTHY, WARNING, CRITICAL, UNKNOWN
- `HealthMetric` (dataclass): Metric data container
- `HealthThreshold` (dataclass): Alert thresholds
- `HealthConfiguration`: Configuration management

#### 2. `health_checks.py` (~400 lines)  
**Purpose**: System health check implementations
- CPU, memory, disk usage monitors
- Network connectivity checks
- Service availability validators
- Custom health check framework

**Key Classes**:
- `SystemResourceChecker`: CPU, memory, disk monitoring
- `NetworkHealthChecker`: Connectivity and latency checks
- `ServiceHealthChecker`: Process and service validation
- `CustomHealthChecker`: User-defined health checks

#### 3. `health_reporters.py` (~350 lines)
**Purpose**: Health status reporting and alerting
- Metric aggregation and analysis
- Threshold-based alerting
- Report generation and formatting
- Integration with logging framework

**Key Classes**:
- `HealthReporter`: Main reporting coordinator
- `HealthAnalyzer`: Metric analysis and trend detection
- `AlertManager`: Threshold monitoring and notifications
- `HealthDashboard`: Status summary generation

#### 4. `health_monitoring.py` (~450 lines)
**Purpose**: Main orchestration scriptlet
- Health monitoring lifecycle management
- Scheduled health check execution
- Framework0 integration and context management
- Configuration and setup coordination

**Key Classes**:
- `HealthMonitoringScriptlet`: Main orchestrator
- Health check scheduling and execution
- Framework0 context integration
- Configuration management

#### 5. `__init__.py` (~60 lines)
**Purpose**: Module exports and convenience functions
- Public API definitions
- Convenience function exports
- Cross-module integration helpers

## Integration Points

### With Logging Framework
- **Health events logging**: All health status changes logged
- **Performance metrics**: Health check durations tracked
- **Audit trails**: Health check execution history
- **Error reporting**: Failed health checks logged with context

### With Framework0 Core
- **Context integration**: Health status stored in Framework0 context
- **Recipe coordination**: Health checks can be recipe steps
- **Dependency management**: Other scriptlets can check system health
- **Lifecycle hooks**: Health monitoring during recipe execution

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Monitoring
- **System Resources**: CPU, memory, disk, network monitoring
- **Service Health**: Process monitoring, port checks, connectivity
- **Custom Metrics**: User-defined health indicators
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Configurable alerting levels

### Flexible Configuration
- **Monitoring intervals**: Configurable check frequencies
- **Threshold settings**: Customizable warning/critical levels
- **Check selection**: Enable/disable specific health checks
- **Output formats**: Multiple reporting options

### Framework0 Native
- **Context awareness**: Health data accessible to other components
- **Logging integration**: Seamless integration with logging framework
- **Error handling**: Robust error management with recovery
- **Performance tracking**: Health check performance monitoring

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)
1. Design modular architecture
2. Implement `health_core.py` with basic infrastructure
3. Create configuration management system
4. Build metric data structures

### Phase 2: Health Checks
1. Implement `health_checks.py` with system monitors
2. Build resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
3. Add network and connectivity checks
4. Create custom health check framework

### Phase 3: Reporting & Analysis
1. Implement `health_reporters.py` with reporting logic
2. Build metric aggregation and analysis
3. Add threshold-based alerting
4. Create status dashboard generation

### Phase 4: Framework Integration
1. Implement `health_monitoring.py` orchestrator
2. Add Framework0 context integration
3. Build scheduling and lifecycle management
4. Create configuration and setup coordination

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation
1. Create comprehensive test suite
2. Build test recipes for validation
3. Test Framework0 integration
4. Validate logging integration

## Usage Examples

### Basic Health Monitoring Setup
```python
# Initialize health monitoring
from scriptlets.foundation.health_monitoring import HealthMonitoringScriptlet
from scriptlets.foundation.health import get_health_monitor

# Get health monitor with default configuration
monitor = get_health_monitor('system_health')

# Run health checks
health_status = monitor.check_system_health()
print(f"System Status: {health_status.overall_status}")
```

### Custom Health Checks
```python
# Define custom health check
from scriptlets.foundation.health.health_checks import CustomHealthChecker

def custom_database_check():
    # Custom database connectivity check
    try:
        # Check database connection
        return HealthStatus.HEALTHY, "Database accessible"
    except Exception as e:
        return HealthStatus.CRITICAL, f"Database error: {e}"

# Register custom check
checker = CustomHealthChecker()
checker.register_check('database', custom_database_check)
```

### Integration with Recipes
```yaml
# Recipe using health monitoring
steps:
  - idx: 1
    name: system_health_check
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.foundation.health_monitoring
    function: HealthMonitoringScriptlet
    args:
      action: full_health_check
      thresholds:
        cpu_warning: 70
        memory_warning: 80
    success:
      ctx_has_keys:
        - health.system_status
        - health.check_results
```
