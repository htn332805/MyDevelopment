# Framework0 Recipe Development - Beginner's Guide

Welcome to Framework0! This comprehensive curriculum will teach you recipe development through hands-on, modular exercises that build upon each other to create reusable framework features.

## üìö Learning Path Overview

This curriculum follows Framework0's modular architecture principles:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each exercise focuses on one core concept
- **Progressive Complexity**: Building from basic recipes to advanced patterns
- **Reusable Components**: Each exercise creates framework extensions you can use
- **Interactive Learning**: Step-by-step guidance with feedback checkpoints

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this curriculum, you will:
- Master YAML recipe syntax and Framework0 patterns
- Understand Context system and state management
- Create custom scriptlets and framework extensions
- Build production-ready automation workflows
- Implement error handling and monitoring
- Deploy isolated recipe packages

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Python 3.11+ installed and activated (`source ~/pyvenv/bin/activate`)
- Framework0 workspace properly configured
- Basic understanding of YAML syntax
- Familiarity with command-line operations
